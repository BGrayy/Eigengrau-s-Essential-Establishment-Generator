$chemist.firstName looks <<print $chemist.currentMood.seededrandom()>>, and idly shifts a box of <<print $chemist.ingredients.random()>> as $chemist.heshe talks. The $chemist.raceNote <<print $chemist.chitchat.seededrandom()>> as you peruse the shop. $chemist.firstName tells you that $chemist.heshe is working on <<print setup.articles.output($brew.potionPurpose)>>, and points to the <<linkappend $brew.containerDescription>>. Looking inside the $brew.vesselType, you see <<print setup.articles.output( $brew.liquidDescription)>> bubbling away<</linkappend>>.
