/**
 * Gives a random value from a static table.
 * Designed to be less performance-intensive than weightedRandomFetcher,
 *
 * The table should contain the intended probabilities of each result
 * for example, calling rollFromTable([[1, 'a'], [2, 'b']])
 * would return 'a' 1/3 of the time, and b 2/3 of the time.
 *
 * Defining maxRoll is not strictly necessary, although I recommend
 * doing so to prevent re-computing the same total of probabilites.
 *
 * Using bias will make certain outcomes more likely. Negative biases
 * skew results toward the first entries, and positive biases skew
 * toward the last entries.
