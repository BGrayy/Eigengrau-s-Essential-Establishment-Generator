Eigengrau's Essential Establishment Generator is a system agnostic tool designed to create towns, taverns, and the people that populate them in an instant. This is most useful for Dungeon Masters in roleplaying games, such as Dungeons and Dragons.

This generator is different because it generates text that you can read out to players. Instead of "Dirty tavern, with a half orc bartender", you get whole paragraphs of text to immerse your players in the world that you've created.\

The towns that it creates are also self-referential, and consistent; you won't have a tavern that's filthy, but is renowned for being a high-end dining club that caters to kings. Similarly, a tavern that is terribly poor and disgusting isn't going to charge an arm and a leg.\

You have control over these factors though; there are sliders to fine tune exactly how large, wealthy, disgusting, rough, seedy, popular, and pricey the various establishments are. If you would rather not have to deal with that, you can toggle this in the settings page in the sidebar.\

A lot of content is hidden behind hyperlinks, for ease of navigation. To reveal the text, simply click on any link that lets you<span class="tip" title="there are also popups!"><<linkreplace ". like this.">>. Good job!<</linkreplace>></span>\

If you get lost, you can always click on the text in the top left corner, which currently reads "The $town.type of $town.name". That will take you to the homepage.\
