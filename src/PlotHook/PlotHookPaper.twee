You see a noticeboard next to the $building.wordNoun's $building.material bar. Walking over to it, you see a number of barter requests nailed to the noticeboard; simple things like <<print ["'have chook, want grain, have grain, want chook'", "'need an exterminator'", "'need help with rat problems'", "'hungry, don't want to walk'", "'need my roof cleaned'", "'I want an apple'", "'need a date for an upcoming wedding'"].random()>>.
